# Foundational Consciousness Framework (FCF)

The **Foundational Consciousness Framework (FCF)** is an open research project proposing **Consciousness as the sole fundamental reality** and developing a rigorous ontological and formal structure to study its self-manifestation as knowledge, observers, time, and worlds.

This repository is not a philosophical essay, belief system, or physical theory.
It is a **foundational framework** intended for long-term, collaborative investigation.

---

## Core Idea (In One Paragraph)

FCF postulates that **Consciousness is self-existing, unified, and irreducible**, possessing an infinite potential for states and structures.
Reality as experienced — worlds, objects, observers, laws, and time — emerges from **self-differentiation of Consciousness** and the stabilization of internal differences as **knowledge**.
Formal models are introduced only to describe manifested structures, never to replace the ontological foundation.

## How to Read This Framework

### Recommended Reading Order

1. `ontology/ontological_manifesto.md`  
   *What is fundamentally real?*

2. `ontology/levels_of_description.md`  
   *How ontology, manifestation, and formalism are separated.*

3. `ontology/definitions.md`  
   *Precise meanings of core concepts.*

4. `formalism/consciousness_state_space.md`  
   *Formal modeling of manifested knowledge.*

5. `formalism/differences_and_divergences.md`

6. `formalism/dynamics_and_time.md`

7. `formalism/observers_and_measurement.md`

This order is strongly recommended to avoid category errors.

## What This Framework Is — and Is Not

### This Framework Is:
- ontologically radical but structurally disciplined,
- compatible with multiple interpretations (physical, cognitive, cosmological),
- open to formal development,
- designed for long-term collaboration.

### This Framework Is Not:
- a physical theory,
- a neuroscience model,
- a religious or mystical doctrine,
- a replacement for empirical science.

Any empirical or physical interpretation must remain **secondary and derived**.

---

## Mathematical and Formal Notation

Mathematical expressions are written using **LaTeX-style notation as plain text** for maximal portability and clarity in version control systems.

Rendered equations may appear only in derived publications or external presentations.

---

## Contributing

All contributions must strictly respect:
- the ontological commitments,
- the separation of descriptive levels,
- and the architectural integrity of the Framework.

Before proposing changes, please read:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `ontology/levels_of_description.md`

Contributions that dilute, reify, or contradict the ontology will not be accepted.

## Status of the Project

FCF is in an **early foundational phase**.

Current focus:
- ontological clarity,
- formal consistency,
- protection against conceptual drift.

Expansion into applications and interpretations will occur only after the foundation stabilizes.

---

## Invitation

Researchers in philosophy, mathematics, physics, cognitive science, information theory, and related fields are welcome — provided they are willing to engage carefully with the ontological premises.

This project values:
- clarity over speed,
- coherence over popularity,
- depth over breadth.

## Closing Note

FCF begins from a simple but demanding position:

> **Nothing stands outside Consciousness.**

Everything else follows.
