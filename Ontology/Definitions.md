# Definitions
## Core Concepts of the Foundational Consciousness Framework

This document provides **precise definitions** of core terms used throughout the Foundational Consciousness Framework (FCF).

All definitions must be interpreted in accordance with:
- `ontology/ontological_manifesto.md`
- `ontology/levels_of_description.md`

In particular, this document distinguishes **ontological primitives** from **formal and descriptive constructs**.

## 1. Consciousness

**Ontological status:** Fundamental, irreducible

**Definition:**

Consciousness is the sole fundamental reality.

It is:
- self-existing,
- unified,
- indivisible in essence,
- and infinite in its potential for states and structures.

Nothing exists outside Consciousness, and nothing explains it.

Consciousness is not:
- a physical field,
- a computational process,
- a mental object,
- or a collection of experiences.

All experiences, observers, objects, and worlds are manifestations of Consciousness and have no independent ontological status.

---

## 2. Self-Differentiation

**Ontological status:** Fundamental property of Consciousness

**Definition:**

Self-differentiation is the intrinsic capability of Consciousness to generate internal distinctions while remaining unified.

The primary form of self-differentiation gives rise to relational poles:
- Subject (Observer)
- Object (Observed)

These poles are not separate substances.
They are relational aspects within Consciousness itself.

---

## 3. Intention

**Ontological status:** Fundamental aspect of self-knowledge

**Definition:**

Intention is the orientation of Consciousness toward self-knowledge.

It is not desire in a psychological sense,
nor an externally caused force.

Intention expresses Consciousness’s intrinsic tendency to know itself.

---

## 4. Awareness

**Ontological status:** Processual aspect of self-knowledge

**Definition:**

Awareness is the act by which Consciousness recognizes internal distinctions generated through self-differentiation.

Awareness is:
- not passive observation,
- not representation,
- but an active act of distinction.

---

## 5. Knowledge

**Ontological status:** Emergent, manifested structure

**Definition:**

Knowledge is stabilized difference within Consciousness.

It is:
- not external information,
- not representation of an independent world,
- but a structural fixation of distinctions generated through awareness.

Knowledge corresponds to changes in the structure of Consciousness itself.

All manifested reality consists of configurations of knowledge.

---

## 6. Difference

**Ontological status:** Manifestational primitive

**Definition:**

Difference is the distinguishability between aspects or states of Consciousness.

Difference:
- is not separation between substances,
- but relational distinction within unity.

At the manifested level, differences become fixed as knowledge.

---

## 7. Observer (Subject)

**Ontological status:** Emergent, relational structure

**Definition:**

An observer is a stabilized configuration of differences within Consciousness that functions as a reference structure.

The observer:
- is not external to Consciousness,
- is not an independent agent,
- and has no absolute perspective.

Each observer corresponds to a local and relative world.

---

## 8. Object (Observed)

**Ontological status:** Emergent, relational structure

**Definition:**

An object is a configuration of knowledge differentiated relative to an observer.

Objects:
- have no observer-independent existence,
- are defined by relational distinctions,
- and exist only within manifested structures of knowledge.

---

## 9. World

**Ontological status:** Emergent, relative structure

**Definition:**

A world is a coherent, stabilized configuration of knowledge associated with a particular observer.

Worlds are:
- local,
- relative,
- and internal to Consciousness.

There is no single absolute world.

---

## 10. Harmony

**Ontological status:** Fundamental tendency of Consciousness

**Definition:**

Harmony is the intrinsic tendency of Consciousness to integrate, stabilize, and coherently organize the knowledge it generates.

Harmony underlies:
- stability of structures,
- emergence of laws,
- and persistence of worlds.

---

## 11. Formal Constructs (Clarification)

Terms such as:
- state space,
- metrics,
- divergences,
- dynamics,
- time,
- and measurement

belong strictly to the **formal level of description**.

They are tools for analyzing manifested knowledge and must never be interpreted as ontological primitives.

---

## 12. Closing Remark

These definitions are binding for all uses of terminology within the Framework.

Any extension or refinement must:
- preserve ontological consistency,
- respect the separation of descriptive levels,
- and avoid reification of formal constructs.
