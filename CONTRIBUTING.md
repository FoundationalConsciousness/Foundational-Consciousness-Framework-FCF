# Contributing to the Foundational Consciousness Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Foundational Consciousness Framework (FCF).

This project is an open research framework, not an opinion forum, belief system, or speculative philosophy space.  
All contributions are expected to meet standards of ontological coherence, conceptual rigor, and methodological clarity.

---

## 1. Nature of the Project

FCF is a foundational research framework based on the ontological primacy of consciousness.

It integrates:
- ontology,
- mathematical formalization,
- interpretation of physical phenomena,
- and conceptual modeling.

The framework is exploratory, but **not arbitrary**.  
Openness does not imply permissiveness toward incoherent or unfounded ideas.

---

## 2. Levels of Contribution

All contributions must clearly specify **which level they address**:

1. **Ontology**  
   Definitions, clarifications, refinements of fundamental concepts  
   (e.g., Consciousness, Difference, Knowledge, Observer)

2. **Formalization**  
   Mathematical structures, metrics, operators, proofs, or models  
   consistent with the ontological layer

3. **Interpretation**  
   Connections to physics, cosmology, quantum theory, or other domains  
   derived from existing formalism

4. **Models and Examples**  
   Toy models, simulations, visualizations, or computational experiments

❗ Mixing levels without explicit separation is not acceptable.

## 3. What Constitutes a Valid Contribution

A valid contribution must satisfy **all** of the following:

- Be explicit about assumptions
- Use precise terminology
- Be internally consistent
- Respect the ontological foundations of the framework
- Clearly distinguish between:
  - definition,
  - formal structure,
  - interpretation,
  - speculation

Contributions that introduce new concepts must:
- define them unambiguously,
- justify their necessity,
- show compatibility with existing ontology.

---

## 4. What Is Not Accepted

The following types of contributions will not be accepted:

- Esoteric, mystical, or spiritual claims
- Appeals to authority without argument
- Statements based on intuition alone (“it feels like”, “I believe”)
- Unformalized metaphors presented as explanations
- Reintroductions of classical materialism without ontological analysis
- Content that ignores or contradicts the core ontological assumptions
  without rigorous justification

This framework is not a platform for:
- personal worldviews,
- belief systems,
- or metaphysical speculation without structure.

---

## 5. Mathematical and Formal Contributions

Formal contributions must:
- clearly define all symbols and spaces,
- specify assumptions and domains,
- explain how the formalism maps onto ontological concepts.

Mathematics without ontological interpretation will be rejected.  
Ontology without potential formalization will be challenged.

---

## 6. Discussions and Issues

- Use **Issues** for questions, critiques, or proposals.
- Use **Discussions** for conceptual debates or exploratory dialogue.
- Use **Pull Requests** only for concrete, well-defined contributions.

When opening an issue or discussion:
- reference relevant documents or sections,
- clearly state the question or problem,
- avoid vague or rhetorical formulations.

## 7. Role of the Maintainer

The project maintainer acts as:
- initiator of the ontological foundation,
- guardian of conceptual coherence,
- facilitator of constructive dialogue.

The maintainer may:
- request clarification or revision,
- reject contributions that dilute the framework,
- restructure content to preserve coherence.

This role is not authoritarian but **architectural**.

## 8. License and Attribution

By contributing, you agree that:
- your contribution is shared under the project’s license,
- proper attribution will be preserved,
- derivative works must respect the same openness principles.

---

## 9. Guiding Principle

Before contributing, ask yourself:

> Does this contribution increase clarity, rigor, and coherence  
> of the framework — or does it add noise?

Only the former moves the project forward.

Thank you for helping develop a rigorous and open framework  
for exploring consciousness as the foundation of reality.
