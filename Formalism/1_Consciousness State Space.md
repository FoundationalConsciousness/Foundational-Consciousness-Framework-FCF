# Consciousness State Space  
## Formal Foundations of the Foundational Consciousness Framework

This document introduces a formal representation of consciousness consistent with the ontological definitions of the Foundational Consciousness Framework (FCF).

The purpose of this formalism is not to describe physical reality directly, but to provide a mathematical structure capable of representing differentiation, knowledge, and observation as internal processes of consciousness.

Mathematical expressions are written in LaTeX-style notation as plain text.

## 1. Motivation and Constraints

The formal model must satisfy the following ontological constraints:

- Consciousness is primary and not derived from physical entities.
- Difference precedes objects, measurement, and observers.
- Knowledge is a structured configuration of differences.
- Observers are secondary, localized structures within consciousness.

Therefore, the formalism must:
- allow representation of states without predefined objects,
- represent difference without presupposing space or time,
- admit quantitative measures of distinguishability,
- support dynamics of change and stabilization.

## 2. State Space of Consciousness

Let 𝓒 denote the **state space of consciousness**.

We postulate that:
- 𝓒 is a mathematical space whose elements represent possible states of differentiation of consciousness.
- A state does not correspond to a physical configuration, but to a configuration of distinctions.

At the most general level, no specific structure is imposed on 𝓒 beyond the requirement that differences between states can be meaningfully defined.

In later refinements, 𝓒 may be equipped with additional structure (topological, metric, or vectorial), provided ontological consistency is preserved.

## 3. States as Knowledge Configurations

A state ψ ∈ 𝓒 represents a **configuration of knowledge**, understood as a stabilized pattern of differences within consciousness.

States are:
- not snapshots of an external world,
- not observer-dependent by definition,
- potentially probabilistic or distributed.

Different states correspond to different internal organizations of distinctions.

## 4. Difference as Distinguishability

A **difference** between two states ψ₁, ψ₂ ∈ 𝓒 is defined as their **distinguishability** within consciousness.

Formally, this requires a function:

D(ψ₁, ψ₂)

that quantifies how distinct two configurations of knowledge are.

The function D must satisfy:

- D(ψ₁, ψ₂) ≥ 0  
- D(ψ₁, ψ₂) = 0 if and only if the states are indistinguishable  
- larger values correspond to greater differentiation  

No symmetry or triangle inequality is assumed at this stage.

Difference is therefore more general than a metric.

---

## 5. Metrics, Divergences, and Distances

To model difference quantitatively, we distinguish between:

- **Metrics**  
  Symmetric measures satisfying the triangle inequality.

- **Divergences**  
  Possibly asymmetric measures of distinguishability.

Ontologically:
- metrics correspond to reciprocal distinguishability,
- divergences correspond to directed or informational difference.

The framework allows both, but does not require metricity.

This flexibility is essential, as informational differences in knowledge need not be symmetric.

---

## 6. Probabilistic Structure and Distributions

To enable concrete measures of difference, states of consciousness may be represented as probability distributions.

A state may be represented by a distribution P = {pᵢ}, where:

- index i labels possible distinctions,
- pᵢ represents the relative significance or activation of a distinction.

This representation:
- does not assume physical randomness,
- models uncertainty, incompleteness, or multiplicity of meaning.

Different distributions correspond to different knowledge structures.

---

## 7. Preparation for Information-Theoretic Measures

Within this representation, differences between states can be quantified using information-theoretic divergences, including but not limited to:

- Kullback–Leibler divergence  
- Jensen–Shannon divergence  
- Hellinger distance  

These measures:
- quantify distinguishability between knowledge configurations,
- naturally arise from probabilistic representations,
- align with the ontological notion of difference.

Formal definitions and ontological interpretations of these measures are introduced in subsequent documents.

---

## 8. Dynamics and Change

Change in consciousness is represented as a trajectory in state space:

ψ(t) ∈ 𝓒

Time is not fundamental here;  
it is a parameter indexing transformations of states.

Dynamics correspond to:
- reconfiguration of differences,
- evolution of knowledge structures,
- stabilization or destabilization of patterns.

Specific dynamical laws are not assumed at this level.

## 9. Ontological Consistency

This formalism preserves the ontological priority:

1. Consciousness → state space  
2. Difference → distinguishability  
3. Knowledge → structured states  
4. Observer → derived structure (not yet formalized)

No element of the formalism introduces:
- external objects,
- predefined spacetime,
- primitive observers.

---

## 10. Outlook

This document establishes the minimal formal setting required to model consciousness as a space of differentiated states.

Subsequent steps will:
- define specific divergence measures,
- relate them to entropy and information,
- explore emergent notions of time, gravity, and observation.

The formalism remains open, provided ontological coherence is maintained.
